It's been a while since my last post - less than a hiatus of an entire month, but still.

## What happened?

Yes, procrastination struck again, but school also started. It's been an uphill struggle to get done with my homework, and I'm still buried in a mountain of homework. Another reason why I stopped posting was because I felt like my posts were just too low-quality. Honestly, after spending such a large chunk of time writing these daily, I'm still not very happy with them.

## So, what now?

Well, I'd still like to make a blog post at least once a week, and preferably every 2-3 days. Ideally I'll be able to write about interesting topics each time, but I'm definitely not going to make any promises.

I do want to keep this post short and (hopefully) do a bit more of my homework, but we'll see whether I can win against my inner laziness.

Peace out.
