Yahallo~!

My life is in shambles. Procrastination, depression, social anxiety, the entire shebang. Obviously, I need to make some changes. Now, I'm well-aware of what people these days are doing - getting therapy, using antidepressants, whatever. We're transitioning away from the era where the saying "Just be a man" was the cardinal rule that people went by. I think it's called "toxic masculinity" these days? You might be thinking, *why are you talking about this?*

Being the edgy weeb that I am, instead of doing things the normal way, I'll instead embrace a different set of ideals. More specifically, copying Ayanokoji Kiyotaka.

## I have no idea what you're talking about...

Ayanokoji is the protagonist of the anime / manga / light novel, Classroom of the Elite. It's personally one of my favorite works, but it's no masterpiece. The plot isn't written well, the character development is in shambles, blah blah blah. However, it has really captivated me with the protagonist, Ayanokoji. He's a high school student who pretends to be your average teenager. However, this is the polar opposite of who he actually is. He was raised from birth in his father's educational institute, called the **White Room**. It was able to transform Ayanokoji from being somewhat above average to someone who almost transcends human limits, both intellectually and physically.

*You can cringe. Even I think that this is quite cringe-worthy. Maybe I myself haven't gotten past my chuunibyou phase, who knows...*

## So...

Yes, I'm going to create my own "White Room". This is obviously a hilariously bad idea, as I'm someone who hasn't been able to comprehend the word "discipline" in my life. I'm also a lazy teenager who generally doesn't have much understanding of anything whatsoever. Maybe this is precisely why I'm doing such a silly thing, but whatever. Anyhow, here's my plan:

#### The Goal:

Dopamine "detox"? Become more productive?

#### Duration:

I'll start with a month (probably won't make it), and *maybe* go to 3/6/12 months if it somehow works out.

#### Specifics:

- Minimize entertainment and wasting of time.
- Maximize productivity at all times.
- Set schedule of tasks & activities for each day.

## Why is there a YouTube tag?

I've been planning on doing YouTube for a while now. Not for your everyday reasons like making actual money off of YouTube, but because it's a great way to both hone my marketing skills and potentially gain a way to advertise myself and my products. I think this would be some pretty good content, so here goes nothing.

I'll also (hopefully) be posting daily updates on this blog about my progress, so if anyone's still reading this, it'll get pretty hectic in some time. I'll likely be officially starting my month-long "training" in a day or two, so I'll post another update then.

Bye~
